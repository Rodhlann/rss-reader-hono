I have attempted to set it up such that the frontend repo is open for anyone to edit,
but the backend repos will require additional input from the admin (me).

This is mostly just a GitHub config exercise for me! Let me know if it's weird. 

# Projects

## Frontend

- `cd frontend`
- `cp .env-template .env`
- `npm run dev`

NOTE: This will just show you mock data, since the local dev server can't reach the internal cloudflare network I've built around
